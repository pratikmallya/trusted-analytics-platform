  A Platform-as-a-Service cloud stack for data scientists and application developers.
description: |
  Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP) is open source software, optimized for performance and
  security, that accelerates the creation of Cloud-native applications driven by Big Data
  Analytics.  TAP makes it easier for developers and data scientists, at enterprises,
  CSPs and SIs, to collaborate by providing a shared, flexible environment for advanced
  analytics in public and private Clouds.  Data scientists get extensible tools, scalable
  algorithms and powerful engines to train and deploy predictive models.  Developers get
  consistent APIs, services and runtimes to quickly integrate these models into
  applications.  System Operators get an integrated stack that they can easily provision
  in a Cloud infrastructure.
  
  This deployment is intended for simple usages and getting familiar with the platform.
  It is not  designed for production grade usages.

  #### Getting Started
  
  If you're new to Trusted Analytics Platform, the
  [Trusted Analytics Platform Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/trustedanalytics/platform-wiki/wiki/Getting%20Started%20Guide)
  will guide you through the platform usages and configuration. 

  This template allows you to create fully functional TAP instance in Rackspace Public
  Cloud. When the deploymnet is finished Stack Details page will contain all the details
  that will allow you login in to the platform (i.e. Cloud Foundry API endpoint, username
  and password, SSH private key).  

  For detailed information on Platform capabilities and management refer to
  [Trusted Analytics Platform Wiki] (https://github.com/trustedanalytics/platform-wiki).
